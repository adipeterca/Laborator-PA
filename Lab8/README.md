<h1>Laboratory 8</h1>

For the database part, I did the following:
<ul>
    <li>I have created two classes: MovieDao and GenresDao, alongside the respective entities</li>
    <li>I set up a local database in Oracle and connected to it (using the pom.xml dependencies)</li>
    <li>I have implemented the Singleton pattern for the database connection</li>
    <li>I added some code in the Main class to ilustrate the functionalities mentioned</li>
</ul>

For the optional part, I have added the following:
<ul>
    <li>two new tables, namely 'actors' and 'directors', visible in the <a href="https://github.com/adipeterca/Laborator-PA/blob/main/Lab8/database_script.sql">.sql</a> script.</li>
    <li>an OO model of the database, which binds all the above mentioned classes togheter</li>
    <li>a DatabaseManager class, which has a very nice interactive way of adding information into the database.</li>
    <li>I have created packages for entities, services and connections (for a cleaner code)</li>
</ul>
