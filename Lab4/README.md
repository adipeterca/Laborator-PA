<strong>Laboratory 4</strong>

I have added the compulsory part (in the Main class, there exists a method called <em>compulsory</em> where I describe everything I did).

<br>

I have also worked on the optional part, adding three new classes: a Problem class, a Solution class and an Algorithm class. Besides these three, I have added a test class called AlgorithmTest, which test if the algorithm implemented is correct (which it is).

I have also used a third-party library for generating fake names for students and schools and tested it on a given example (of 100 students and 20 schools).

All of the above can be found in the <em>optional</em> function from the Main class.
