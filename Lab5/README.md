Laboratory 5 

I did the compulsory part, implementing a Catalog class, a CatalogUtil class (with static methods) and an abstract Item class, alongside two separate classes (that implement the Item class): Song class and Image class.

Besides this, I implemented a CustomException class, used to catch exceptions and handling them. The class extends the Exception class.

The code is well documented and has comments within it.
