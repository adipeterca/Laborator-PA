Laboratory 5 

I did the compulsory part, implementing a Catalog class, a CatalogUtil class (with static methods) and an abstract Item class, alongside two separate classes (that implement the Item class): Song class and Image class.

Besides this, I implemented a CustomException class, used to catch exceptions and handling them. The class extends the Exception class.

The code is well documented and has comments within it.

<h6> Later edit </h6>
I have added the optional part containing classes like AddCommand, ListCommand etc. All of them (alongside with the exception CommandException class) are in a package called OptionalClasses.
In the Main class, I have added two static methods, namely <em>compulsory</em> and <em>optional</em>.
The HTML report has also been done.
The JAR arhive can be found in the /out/artifacts/Lab5_jar2 folder.
